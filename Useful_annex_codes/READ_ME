Those codes are either judged as useful in regard of the EasyMPE outputs or were used to get results for the publication.

Here are the explanations for each code:
  - Intersection_over_union (folder) contains the codes used to get the Intersection Over Union ratio that characterizes how overlapped
    two area are. In the context of this code, handmade microplots and EasyMPE microplots were compared. These codes are useful if you
    want to judge by yourself the efficiency of the EasyMPE program. All details are displayed at the start of the IOU_ratio.py.
  - Reverse_calculation (folder) contains the codes to make a reverse calculation without using EasyMPE.
          _ Reverse_calculation.py is the code to make the reverse calculation.
          _ Plot_all_raw_image.py allows to get an image with all the plot position in the different raw image so the best one can be
            chosen according to the user needs
          _ Cropping_raw_image.py allows to the designated plot from the indicated raw drone image.
  - Merge_shp.py allows to merge individual files with the same nature (such as file from the SHP_files folder from the EasyMPE outputs)
  - get_coordinates_from_shp.py gets the geo-referenced coordinates of the inputted shp folder
  - get_tiff_from_shp.py cut a tiff file following files from a shapefile folder. It does not use GDAL.
  - make_raster_from_arrays.py allows to georeference a non-georeferenced image. Useful if the EasyMPE code needs the binarization to be
    done already and if the user still wants to do the reverse calculation.
  - make_shp_from_coord.py makes shp files based on the input coordinates and a georeferenced raster.
