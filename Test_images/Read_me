There is a total of 6 trial images:
  - Soybean Tanashi
  - Soybean Tsukuba
  - Sugar beet Memuro Field 1
  - Sugar beet Memuro Field 2
  - Sugar beet Memuro Hybrid
  - Sugar beet Memuro Production
The input parameters can be see in the file 'Test_images_parameters'.
For each field, the base image has been uploaded as well as an image with the field delimitation used in the trials.

For Memuro Field 1 & 2, the binary images has been used. The original images are available but the code will not work with
them (binarization not working).
For Tsukuba, the original image used too much memory for the computer used for the trials. It has been thus resized. The resized version
is not georeferenced. Thus, the reverse calculation cannot be done.
